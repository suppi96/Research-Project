## Abstract
The focus of this project is to classify the outcomes of a chess endgame that involves King-Rook vs King-Pawn, via machine learning. 
The dataset included includes various features of a given chessboard, including but not limited to the various positions of all the necessary chess pieces (in this case white and black kings and white rooks specifically). 
These positions are presented in the form of categorical and numerical features, also known as, columns and rows. The ultimate goal of this project is to predict the outcome of the game and whether or not white is able to win. 
Using PyCaret, the dataset was preprocessed and imputed. PyCaret was able to handle missing values using strategies it deemed up to the task, and a Random Forest model was used as well.
